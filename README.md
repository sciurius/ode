Ode (O-de) is a simple personal publishing engine for the web, written
by Rob Reed. Ode is unique in that it is designed to be simple â€“ not
necessarily easy. Simple means understandable (at least it does here).

Main web site: http://ode.io .

This is my personal version of Ode, enhanced to support
internationalisation (to a certain but hopefully sufficient extent)
with Dutch (nl_NL) translations added.

The custom branch in this repository contains many additional
enancements and additions, some of which you may like. Or maybe not.

I share with you. You share with me?
